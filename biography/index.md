Kirsten began cello lessons in Bristol with Avril Rump, and then moved to London to study for a bachelor degree at the Guildhall School of Music with Louise Hopkins and Leonid Gorokhov, also taking lessons with Sue Lowe. While attending the Eton Cello School, she met renowned soloist Johannes Goritzki. An invitation to join his class led her to transfer her studies to the Royal Scottish Academy in 2008 for the remainder of her bachelors. During her time in Glasgow she performed the Schumann Cello Concerto with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in the City Halls, and since then has participated as a soloist and chamber musician in International masterclasses and festivals throughout the UK, German, France, Amsterdam, Switzerland, Italy, Indonesia and the US, alongside musicians such as Hariolf Schlichtig, Matthias Lingenfelder and Johannes Goritzki.

After completing her Masters degree with Johannes Goritzki in Lugano at the Conservatorio della Svizzera Italiana, she was selected as a masterclass participant at the International Musicians Seminar Prussia Cove, and since then has been performing predominantly as a solo and chamber artist. Numerous prizes and awards include the RSAMD Concerto Competition, the CSI Concerto Competition in Lugano, the Helen Winning Memorial Prize at the Tunbridge Wells International YCA Competition, the Scottish A. Ramsay Calder Debussy Prize, and most recently the 2016 International Music Competition Grand Prize Virtuoso. 

Kirsten has played a number of times as no.2 cellist at the Orchestra della Valle d’Itria, and has worked professionally with the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana and the Britten Sinfonia, although chamber music is a particular passion. In 2014 Kirsten was cellist of the Fontanelli Quartet, who were selected as Park Lane Young Concert Artists, and was a founding member of The Milgram Trio. From 2014 - 2016 she was cellist of the full-time Ragazze Quartet in Holland, with whom she released two albums under the label Channel Classics, and performed regularly at major venues including the Royal Concertgebouw.  Kirsten then joined the London-based Dulcinea Quartet, who held the Carne Fellowship at Trinity College in London from September 2016, alongside multiple tours to  Japan. She played with the Allegri Quartet during the Autumn 2018 to cover their cellist’s maternity leave, and has coached on the chamber music course Procorda. Alongside other projects, Kirsten plays with the urban innovative music group Project Instrumental, and Anima, a chamber ensemble playing contemporary music alongside animated films.

Kirsten plays on a cello made in 1998 by Tony Padday.
