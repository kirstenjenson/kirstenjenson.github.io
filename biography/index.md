Kirsten began cello lessons in Bristol with Avril Rump and moved to London in 2005 to study with Louise Hopkins and Leonid Gorokhov at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. During her years in London, Kirsten was privileged also to play for Sue Lowe, Alexander Baillie and Anner Bylsma.

In 2008 Kirsten transferred to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama to finish her Bachelor degree under the renowned soloist and pedagogue Johannes Goritzki. Particular highlights of her time in Scotland include a performance of the Schumann Cello Concerto with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in City Halls, Glasgow, in February 2010. In May of that year she was selected to perform it again, along with a masterclass taken by Pieter Wispelwey, at the Festival de Violoncelle de Beauvais with the Orchestre Philharmonique du Département de l’Oise.

After winning the Helen Winning Memorial Prize at the summer 2010 Tunbridge Wells International Young Concert Artists competition, Kirsten moved to Lugano, Switzerland, to study for a Master’s degree at the Conservatorio della Svizzera Italiana with Johannes Goritzki. Whilst there she won the 2011 Concerto Competition, resulting in a performance of the Saint-Saens Cello Concerto with orchestra.

Kirsten has performed and taken masterclasses at numerous festivals and courses throughout Europe and America, most recently with Ralph Kirshbaum at the 2013 International Musicians Seminar Prussia Cove, with Steven Isserlis at the 2012 Los Angeles International Piatagorsky Cello Festival, and with Raphael Wallfisch at the 2010 Amsterdam Cello Biennale. Kirsten was selected as a Young Concert Artist for the 2011 Scottish International Cello Festival and the 2013 DG International Musicians Platform, and has also received masterclasses from Wolfgang Boettcher, Anner Bylsma, Colin Carr, Wen-Sinn Yang and Steven Doane.

Alongside her solo work, Kirsten is a keen chamber musician. She has been a full-time member of the Ragazze Quartet in Holland since September 2014, performing numerous live television and radio broadcasts, and at major concert halls including the Royal Concertgebouw and Muziekgebouw aan't IJ. They released their second album with the label Channel Classics, 'Cesko', in April 2015, which was recently chosen as CD of the week on NPO Radio 4.
